Uses builtin json. but adds a lookup dictionary with functions that encode/decode specific types.

TO INSTALL

$ pip install jsonplustypes

by default it is able to:

encode dat
by default it is able to:

* encode datetime,date and bson ObjectId's to and from
  custom TYPE/VALUE dict
* dump with float precision if you want to cut off digits

Custom objects are encoded in the following verbose dict format (with datetime as example):

 {
   _TYPE_TAG:"DATETIME",
   _VALUE_TAG:date_string
 }

the github repo holds a reference javascript implementation of the same json serialization/deserialization

CHANGELOG:
==========
0.7.5:
fixed the strange float precision limiter
not based on monkeypatching the json.encoder.FLOAT_REPR and json.encoder.c_make_encoder, which means it now runs without the C speedups

0.7:
added encoder for datetime.date and bson ObjectId

0.6:
fixed bug - JSONEncoder -> json.JSONEncoder
